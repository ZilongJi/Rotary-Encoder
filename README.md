# Rotary-Encoder
This is the matlab code to read data from the RLS rotary encoder.

I have already put the code (from https://www.rls.si/eng/e201-usb-encoder-interface-123) for E201-9Q Matlab interface into this repo. 

How to run:

1, run the matlab code xxx.m \
2, then you will pres a key 'g' (means go) on the key board to start logging the information from the Rotary-Encoder to a txt file in the Log file folder. \
3, after the imaging process finished, you will press a key 'b' (means break) on the key board to stop the logging. \

Easy and simple!
